== Behind the Plug-in ==

I have built a lot of websites for churches in recent months. I found my customers like to have a space where they can promote regular events and activities.

Adding a post works, but they needed to be able to add a couple of other pieces of information along with it, which is why I created this plug-in, so **phpete - what's on** was born.

== Buy me a coffee ==

This plugin is **free**, with no hidden costs after installing.
